Question 1: Tax Calculator

**Scenario**: Sophia is building a tax calculator for a retail store. She needs a program that calculates the total cost including tax for a given purchase amount and tax rate.

**Hint**: Sophia can create a method named `calculateTotalWithTax` that takes two doubles (purchase amount and tax rate) as inputs and returns the calculated total cost. Inside the method, she should calculate the tax amount using the formula `purchase amount * tax rate`, then add it to the purchase amount.

Sample Output:

Enter the purchase amount: 100

Enter the tax rate (in decimal form): 0.08

Total cost including tax: 108.0
