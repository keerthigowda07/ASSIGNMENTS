Question 31: Bitwise Bit Counter
 
**Scenario**: Mia is exploring bitwise operations and wants to count the number of set (1) 
its in a given integer. She needs a program that takes an integer as input and displays the 
count of set bits.
 
**Hint**: Mia can create a method named `countSetBits` that takes an integer as input and 
returns the count of set bits. Inside the method, she can use bitwise AND operation with 
a mask to check the value of each bit.
 Sample Output:
Enter an integer: 22
Number of set bits: 3
