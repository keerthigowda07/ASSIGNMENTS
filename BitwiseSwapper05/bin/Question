Question 3: Bitwise Swapper

**Scenario**: Noah is working on a program that swaps the values of two variables 
using bitwise XOR operation. He needs a program that takes two integers as input 
and displays the swapped values.

**Hint**: Noah can create a method named `swapUsingBitwise` that takes two integers 
as inputs and swaps their values using bitwise XOR. He should use a temporary 
variable to hold one of the values during swapping.

Sample Output:

Enter the first integer: 5

Enter the second integer: 8

After swapping: First = 8, Second = 5
