Question 29: Logical Operator Validator

**Scenario**: Ethan is developing a user registration system. He needs a program that validates user input based on multiple conditions using logical operators.

**Hint**: Ethan can create a method named `isValidInput` that takes two booleans (one indicating if the input is valid and the other indicating if the input meets a certain condition) as inputs and returns a boolean value. Inside the method, he can use logical operators (AND, OR) to combine the conditions and determine if the input is valid.

Sample Output:

Is input valid (true/false): true

Does input meet a certain condition (true/false): true

Input is valid.
